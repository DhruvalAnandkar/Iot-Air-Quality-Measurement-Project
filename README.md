# Air Quality Monitoring (Arduino, IoT)
Duration: Dec 2021 - Jan 2022

# Associated with Parul University

During my tenure at Parul University, I led the development of an IoT-based air quality monitoring system using Arduino and MQ-series sensors. This project aimed to detect levels of CO2 and PM2.5 pollutants in real-time, transmitting data to a cloud platform for actionable insights.

# Key Responsibilities and Achievements:

# System Design and Implementation: 
Designed and implemented an IoT solution using Arduino IDE for programming and integrating MQ-series sensors to detect CO2 and PM2.5 levels in the environment. Ensured accurate sensor calibration and data collection.

# Real-time Data Transmission: 
Established communication protocols to transmit real-time air quality data from the Arduino-based system to a cloud-based platform. Implemented secure data transmission protocols to maintain data integrity and confidentiality.

# Cloud Integration: 
Integrated the IoT system with a cloud database to store and analyze air quality data efficiently. Implemented data visualization tools to monitor trends and patterns in pollutant levels over time, facilitating informed decision-making.

# Technical Proficiency: 
Developed proficiency in Arduino programming and sensor integration, gaining hands-on experience with MQ-series sensors for accurate pollutant detection. Acquired skills in cloud database management and data analytics to derive meaningful insights from collected data.

# Project Documentation: 
Prepared comprehensive documentation detailing system architecture, sensor specifications, data transmission protocols, and cloud integration strategies. Ensured documentation clarity to facilitate future maintenance and scalability of the system.

# Collaborative Efforts: 
Collaborated with team members and academic mentors to troubleshoot technical challenges, optimize system performance, and ensure project milestones were achieved within stipulated timelines.
